# DogADay

DogADay is an iOS app that helps track your pet's growth over time with daily images.

These images are then strung together as a time lapse so you can always remember how smol they once were. :dog:


## Requirements
<i>A code signing key from Apple is required to deploy apps to a device. Without a developer key, the app can only be installed on the iPhone/iPad Simulator.</i>

* CocoaPods

* iOS 13 SDK
* An iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch running iOS 8.0 or newer

Run the following command from the Terminal to install the required libraries, and then open the generated DogADay.xcworkspace file to build and run the app.
